## Practice PHP

#### Challenge 1: Correct Change
When cashiers in a store give you change they try first try to "fit" dollars into the amount you get back, then try to "fit" quarters (25 cent coins) into what is left over, they try to "fit" dimes (10 cent coins) into what is now left over, then try to "fit" nickels (5 cent coins) into what is left, and finally are left with a few odd cents. For example, say that your change is 159 cents:
Write a program that takes a number representing the change due to a user (in cents) and writes out how many dollars, quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies she is due in change, e.g. “Your change is: 1 dollar, two quarters, one dime, and three cents”.  You are welcome to add additional PHP/HTML/CSS to improve the design or function of your page.

#### Challenge 2: 99 Bottles of Beer
"99 Bottles of Beer" is a song that has a very repetitive format which is easy to memorize, and can take a long time to sing. The song's simple lyrics are as follows:
99 bottles of beer on the wall, 99 bottles of beer. Take one down, pass it around, 98 bottles of beer on the wall.
The same verse is repeated, each time with one fewer bottle. The song is completed when the singer reaches zero.
a. Write a PHP program that prints the full lyrics of the song on the page. You are welcome to add additional PHP/HTML/CSS to improve the design or function of your page.  
b. Modify your code, such that you can print out the song for any number of starting beers, e.g. with 4 bottles of beer:
